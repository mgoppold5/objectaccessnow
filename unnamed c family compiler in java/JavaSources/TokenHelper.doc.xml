This interface supports token helper functionality.

A token helper evaluates the characters of a stream,
and the TokenHelperData tells the results.
Token helper modules tell whether,
the characters evaluate to a valid token.

which it hasnt read any characters.
</desc></function>

<function name="advanceOneChar"><desc>
makes the token helper handle a char, and moves
the helper's internal index past the char.
</desc></function>

<function name="processEndOfStream"><desc>
