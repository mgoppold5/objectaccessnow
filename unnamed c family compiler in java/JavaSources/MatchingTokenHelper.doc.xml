<desc>
A token helper for constant strings.
</desc>
<body>

<function name="narrowWithChar"><desc>
<p>
Updates the matching range and the most recent matching token,
which apply to the stream's string.
</p>
<p>
The range eventually narrows until the values are equal,
which then represents matching nothing.
But, on the way to nothing, if the new minIndex
is on a string that ends on the current char, we
have a match.
