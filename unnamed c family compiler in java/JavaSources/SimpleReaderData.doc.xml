<desc>
Data for SimpleReader parser modules.

<body>

<constant name="STATE_HAVE_SYMBOL"><desc>
This state means that a symbol is ok/ready/waiting.
</desc></constant>

<var name="nodeStack"><desc>
A stack of SimpleReaderNode-s,
which pretty much houses the whole parser state.
</desc></var>

<var name="nodeStackIndex"><desc>
Index for the current node in nodeStack.
</desc></var>

<var name="ccStack"><desc>
<p>
A stack of re-use-able CharReaderContext-s.
</p>
<p>
While functions use this stack,
they should know,
what positions they are using,
and the beginning position of unused ones.
</p>
<p>
Once the stack is sufficiently large,
the parser does not need to do any more allocation.
