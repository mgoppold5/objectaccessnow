<p>
A buffer for a partial segment of a larger constant source.
</p>
<p>
It has a begin position and end position within
the larger source.
The end position of the excerpt is calculated
using the bufferCombo's length.
The larger source is assumed to be read only, and further,
it is assumed that the source is constant.
</p>
</desc>
<body>

<var name="isAtEnd"><desc>
If the end position of the excerpt marks the end of the source.
</desc></var>

<var name="isAtBeginning"><desc>
If startIndex marks the beginning of the source.
</desc></var>

<var name="extraBufData1"><desc>
One of a few extra byte arrays which has been deallocated
from this buffer, and can be re-used.  The purpose
of keeping them is to improve speed.  I am not sure if
this really offers a speed improvement, so I may delete
these variables in the future.
</desc></var>

<function name="clear"><desc>
Clears the buffer and increments versionNumber.
